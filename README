0. Please write down the full names and netids of all your team members.
    Bandy Wang (bw307) and WeiJi Zheng (wz232).

1. Briefly discuss how you implemented the LS functionality of tracking which TS responded to the query and timing out
   if neither TS responded.
   From LS, two child threads are used to send the query to ts1 and ts2. The seperate connections that send the query
   would have a 5 second timeout interval if there is no response from the TS. There will be a flag (called Event in the
   code) that would set if a thread would finish first. The parent thread will keep on checking on this flag every
   millisecond, and will kill both threads once the flag is set.

2. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
   attached code? If so, explain.
   No issues known of.

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?
   An issue was that python inherently disabled killing threads before the thread ended naturally. We found a way around
   it by creating a custom thread class.

4. What did you learn by working on this project?
   We learn a but more about multi-threading.
